This commit introduces a new `codeReviewAgent` that leverages the Gemini 2.5 Pro model to perform code reviews. 

The agent is equipped with tools to:
- Get file changes in a directory.
- Generate commit messages.
- Create markdown files.

The `index.ts` file is updated to include the `codeReviewAgent`, and the `prompts.ts` file is extended with more specific instructions for the agent. The `package.json` file is updated with new dependencies required for the tools.
